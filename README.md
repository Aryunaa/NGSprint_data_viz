# NGSprint hackathon

Hello and welcome to the NGSprint Data Visualization hackathon!

## tl;dr

You will find materials and instructions for the Data Visualization hackathon during NGSprint event.

**When**: 8 - 15.09.2021  
**Where**: Discord & Zoom

More info about the event can be found on [the website](https://ngschool.eu/ngsprint/). 

## Aim

During this hackathon we will explore what makes a good figure and how to avoid common pitfalls. We will discuss which rules are important and which we can treat as suggestions. 

## Preparation

The tutorial part of the hackathon will be run in R, therefore you will need:

* A recent version of R [(download fromhere)](https://cloud.r-project.org/);
* A recent version of RStdudio [(download from here)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* packages listed in `prep_help.R` (you will also find helper functions to install the packages in the file).

~~If you run into issues installing R and RStudio you can try [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/projects) - you will need to set up an account and install the packages using the code in the `prep_help.R` file.~~ <- edited as the RStudio Cloud free account does not give enough resources. 



### Previous knowledge
